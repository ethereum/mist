Some common issues are:

- Ether is not shown in the wallet
- I send ether to the wallet contract but it doesn't show up
- Mist is synchronized but is stuck during the last part
- "Your computers time is out of sync!" error
- Unable to find peers
- My transaction is not confirmed
- Account can't be unlocked
- Unable to import pre-sale wallet
- Bind address already in use

You'll find possible solutions for those on Mist Wiki: https://github.com/ethereum/mist/wiki

If possible add the following to your report:
- Screenshots
- Check the console, of Mist (`CTRL/CMD + ALT + i`) and take a screenshot
- Log files
  - go to `menu -> accounts -> backup -> application data`
  - zip and upload `node.log` and all other `node.log.X` files
